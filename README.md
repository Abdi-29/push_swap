# Push_Swap

#### Push swap is an algorithm project at Codam. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks, **stack A** and **stack B**, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. Data will need to be sorted, you must take the random list of numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest.
