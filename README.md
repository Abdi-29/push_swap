# Push_Swap

#### Push swap is an algorithm project at Codam. You have at your disposal a set of int values, 2 stacks, **stack A** and **stack B**, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. Data will need to be sorted, you must take the random list of numbers in Stack A and sort them so that Stack A is organized from smallest to largest. 

#### Operations that you're allowed to use on the both stacks:

##### **sa: swap a** -  swap the first 2 elements at the top of **stack a**.
##### **sb: swap b** -  swap the first 2 elements at the top of **stack b**.
##### **ss: swap a** -  **sa** and **sb** at the same time.
##### **pa: push a** -  - take the first element at the top of **b** and put it at the top of **a**.
##### **pb: push b** -  - take the first element at the top of **a** and put it at the top of **b**.
##### **ra : rotate a** - shift up all elements of **stack a** by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
##### **rb : rotate b** - shift up all elements of **stack b** by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
##### **rr : ra** and **rb** at the same time.
##### **rra : reverse rotate a** - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
##### **rrb : reverse rotate b** - shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
##### **rrr : rra** and **rrb** at the same time.
